The `metadata-booster` package ( `ðŸ“„ packages/metadata-booster` ) is a transformer for the TypeScript compiler.

â¬œ 27         "src/**/*"
```

What this package does is to parse all classes annotated with a decorator, capture the types of the fields, and adds some specific function calls to the generated code that was generated by the
